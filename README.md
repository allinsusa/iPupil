Electronic Class Register

There are 3 actors in this system i.e
1. Administrator 
2. Teacher
3. Parent

This system basically allows teachers to have a paperless register. Students use their smartphones to scan a QR Code 
which is created by the system and printed by the teacher everyday . QR Code info consists of current date , time , location
as well as class code. 

If scan is successful , the system marks the student present on the register .  An email is also sent to the students parent 
informing them that their child is in class.
